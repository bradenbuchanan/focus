## Implementation Priorities

### Priority 1: User Value First

- Focus on delivering the core timer functionality early
- Enable basic analytics to show immediate value
- Create a solid foundation before adding complexity

### Priority 2: Technical Dependencies

- Build authentication before user-specific features
- Implement database infrastructure before advanced analytics
- Develop payment systems before premium feature gating

### Priority 3: Risk Mitigation

- Address timer accuracy issues early
- Test real-time features thoroughly before scaling
- Implement robust error handling for critical paths

### Priority 4: Progressive Enhancement

- Start with essential features, then add sophistication
- Allow for user feedback to guide later development phases
- Balance new feature development with refinement of existing features

## Key Technical Considerations

### State Management Strategy

- Local state for UI components
- React Query/SWR for server state
- Context API for global app state

### Database Design

- Optimize schema for analytics queries
- Plan for data growth with time-series data
- Consider data partitioning strategy early

### API Architecture

- RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- WebSockets for real-time features
- Server actions for form submissions

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for utility functions
- Component tests for UI elements
- Integration tests for critical flows
- E2E tests for key user journeys

## Potential Challenges & Mitigations

### Timer & Session Accuracy

- Implement timer drift correction
- Handle background tab throttling
- Save timer state frequently
- Recover gracefully from disconnections

### Group & Real-time Features
